# Current results

- Find more or less optimal hyperparameters for DQN-LunarLander  
    ![LunarLander](/docs/LunarLanderSimple.png)  
    Plot averaged over 4 experiments  

- Launch Layerwise, Global and ERPruners  
    [ComparePruners](/docs/ComparePruners.md)

- Use rescaling after pruning  
    TODO add plot  
- Use bigger network  
    TODO it works?  
- Reinitialize network not to initial random weights, but some weights later in training  
    TODO It works?
