# BigNet

It starts learning!  
[BigNet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kqhZ0ITvDltHLpISnOKFoyb4u8OV6GBV)  
Probably it could learn on first iteration with right hyperparams?  
Does out way of pruning work, or just random would perform similiar?  

ERPruner looks better than Global  
But by construction it cannot work with extreme pruning rates on last iterations  
TODO try layerwise
